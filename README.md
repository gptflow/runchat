## What is RunChat?

RunChat is like a conveyor belt for ChatGPT tasks. It's like having a production line where you can set up and run several tasks, big or small, one after another, or even all at once. With RunChat, you can take all these separate tasks, whether they're simple or complex, and piece them together into one smooth operation.

### Before we start: ChatGPT API KEY

RunChat uses the ChatGPT API, so in order to run the examples from this manual, you will need an API key. Here's what you need to do to create a key:

- Go to OpenAI's Platform website at platform.openai.com and sign in with an OpenAI account.
- Click your profile icon at the top-right corner of the page and select "View API Keys."
- Click "Create New Secret Key" to generate a new API key.

RunChat expects a key to be avaialable as an environment variable under the `OPENAI_API_KEY` name.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=A_KEY_VALUE_OBTAINED_FROM_THE_SITE
```

### Run you first chat

Alright, let's get started. To call ChatGPT using RunChat, you simply need to run a command:

```bash
npx runchat -m "Hey ChatGPT, how are you?"
```
